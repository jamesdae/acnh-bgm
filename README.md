# ACNH BGM

A web application for fans of Nintendo's Animal Crossing: New Horizons who want to listen to the hourly background music that plays during gameplay.

## Why I Built This

As someone who listens to video game music often while studying, I wanted to build an application I can use on a day to day basis. By building this project, I learned how to utilize REST APIs, as well as how to display media content in web applications.
